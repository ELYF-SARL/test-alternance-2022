# Web page on food information.

Hi! We're glad you want to join ELYF! We've designed this test so that you can show us what you're capable of doing in a free environment. We'll discuss about it during our next meeting.

## Project
A client wants to develop a new app for people to find information about their food. They already have the backend done by [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/), they have an API. They let you free to develop your own web design ideas. The most important for them is that the web page is clean and stylish, and looks modern and professional as much as possible. They also want to be able to maintain it reliably, so using a web framework is recommended! ;) 

### Stage 1: REST API
Go to [Open Food Facts API documentation](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/api-documentation/) and find endpoints and informations on how the API works, try it out, and if you have any question feel free to ask us.

### Stage 2: Web application
Implement a simple web application to show the informations:

- display the list of food products in the form of a table
- add a form so that we can trigger one or more API filters
- add the posibility to show the details of a single product (no need to show all the info, only the most relevant)

### Bonus stages
Those are not required but can be cool to do!

- add a search bar to find specific products
- deploy your application on the web (Heroku for example)
- display some graphs or interesting figures in the web application

Have some cool idea? Go on üëç

## Modalities
You are free to use the languages and tools you are more comfortable with.
Create a repository on GitHub to store your source code and send us the link by e-mail once you've finished.
